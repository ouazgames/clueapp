IMPORTANT: Read carefully and follow strictly.

PROJECT CONTEXT
- This is a Capacitor project (web → iOS/Android).
- This is NOT an Expo project.
- Do NOT use Expo Go.
- The app must be tested on a real iPhone using Xcode.

========================
UI / UX REQUIREMENTS
========================

GOAL:
Recreate the UI EXACTLY like the attached screenshots.
Pixel-perfect replication.
NO redesign.
NO creativity.
NO improvements.

STRICT RULES:
- Do NOT change layout.
- Do NOT change spacing.
- Do NOT change sizes.
- Do NOT change font sizes or weights.
- Do NOT change colors or gradients.
- Do NOT add or remove shadows unless visible in the screenshot.
- Do NOT add any new UI elements.

Gameplay logic defines UI, not the opposite.

ELEMENTS THAT MUST NOT EXIST:
- Devil icon ❌
- Hearts / lives ❌
These do NOT exist in our gameplay and must be completely removed
(from HTML, CSS, and JS if referenced).

========================
HEADER STRUCTURE (FINAL)
========================

TOP ROW:
- Left: Settings icon
- Center: Level text (e.g. "Level 8")
- Right: Coins counter with "+" button

BOTTOM ROW:
- ONLY ONE ELEMENT:
  - Progress bar (centered and wider)
- No devil
- No hearts
- No extra counters

The progress bar must compensate visually for removed elements
(by being centered and wider).

========================
PROGRESS BAR
========================
- Has a visible GREEN fill (not text-only)
- Has a gray rounded container
- Shows progress text (e.g. "1/10") centered
- Same proportions as reference screenshot

========================
COINS SYSTEM (BUG FIX)
========================
Current issue:
Coins are deducted multiple times per click.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Coins must be deducted ONCE per action.
- Add a lock / guard to prevent double or rapid deductions.
- "Show Hint" deducts coins once.
- "Show More" deducts more coins once.
- If coins < cost, action must not execute.

No duplicate event listeners.
No click + touch double execution.

========================
IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS (MANDATORY)
========================

STEP 1:
Describe the UI structure in detail:
- Header
- Top row
- Bottom row
- Progress bar
Do NOT write code yet.

WAIT for confirmation.

STEP 2:
Implement ONLY the header UI (HTML + CSS).
No logic changes yet.
No other screens.

WAIT for confirmation.

STEP 3:
Fix the coins deduction logic.

========================
iOS TESTING (VERY IMPORTANT)
========================

- This is a Capacitor project.
- Do NOT mention Expo or Expo Go.

Prepare the app for testing on a real iPhone:
- npm run build
- npx cap sync ios
- npx cap open ios

The app must be runnable from Xcode on a real device.

========================
ADS
========================
- Add AdMob TEST ads only.
- Do NOT use production ad IDs.

========================
FINAL NOTE
========================
If you redesign, simplify, or add elements that do not exist
in the screenshots or gameplay, the task is FAILED.
